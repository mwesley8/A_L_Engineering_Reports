#A&L Engineering Retrospective

Recently, I successfully completed Physics 150 as it relates to classical Newtonian physics. The course not only increased my awareness of the impact that physics has on daily life, but also solidified some concepts that I had previously learned. I really enjoyed exploring one/two dimensional Kinematic applications.

During the course, I mentioned my hobby. It was exciting to calculate the distance a propeller tip travels during an eight-minute flight, energy consumption of a 30cc engine relative to a human being, and an inelastic collision in a constant mass system. Additionally, the course provided insight into projectile motion by planning a payload drop with environmental considerations.

There was a shift in my understanding of how to calculate final velocity during a free fall. This caused an error in my calculations that propagated throughout my report. I discovered the time independent equation after the instructor corrected the disconnect in my learning process.

The elastic collision lab was the most time consuming. Alternative, it was the most enjoyable. It has been a while since I have played with little blue carts on an incline plane. Smiling as I watched them slam into the showbox. Making loud clanging noises like a kid with no worries.

At first, the roller coaster design project seemed very intimidating. I did not fully grasp the connection between Kinetic energy, Potential energy, and Momentum until after I had to calculate the values for the initial drop and first peak. The final project helped me to better understand energy conservation.
